 <span><center>You can offer information, entertainment, or bargains – it’s up to you. 
    The best part is that you can invent your own types of custom lead magnets, 
    highlighting the benefits only your business can provide.

    Now, let's get into the good stuff – here are 12 lead magnet examples and ideas
     that could transform the way you engage new customers:</center></span><br><br>

             <h3>1.1. Сontent “Bait”</h3>
             Content bait is any piece of content that provides clear and immediate value to your audience. 
             For example:

Text content: How-to guides, reports, whitepapers, cheat sheets, case studies, checklists, etc.

Video content: Video guides and video courses.

Visuals: Infographics.

The first step is to offer a piece of content that can solve your customers’ challenges.

After they click the button and enter their information, they’ll receive an email with your content attached. This offer can be integrated into your page, or it can appear in pop-ups.

Social Media Marketing offered its Industry Report for free, providing a short description on the main page:<br>
In addition, after spending some time on the page, visitors would encounter a pop-up window that offered a download of a free PDF copy: <br> 
             
         </div>
 
         <div class="Global">
             <h3>2. Widgets</h3>
             Widgets are built-in tools that integrate with your website or landing pages. They provide your customers with a unique brand experience by offering them a very customized service. They also enable you to collect valid email addresses, or phone numbers, or other personal data about your prospects. 

For example, some widgets offer a service, a report, or other important information that may be hard to get for free. With the SEMrush Lead Generation tool, you can place a custom widget on your website that allows you to collect business leads. 

When you add the code for the widget to your page, users will see the following sign-up form:

         </div>
 
         <div class="Global">
             <h3>3. Quizzes</h3>
             Gamification can be an effective way to attract leads.
              Using gaming principles allows you to collect the key information
               you need about your prospective clients. 

You might create interactive quizzes to encourage users to leave their email addresses,
 and you can use the collected data for multiple purposes, for example, to customize 
 a ‘welcome’ email series that is tailored to the answers they gave in the quiz.

Tease your prospects, entertain them with a short and simple quiz, and send the results via email; this is a tried and tested way of generating leads. Here’s an example of a simple quiz from a home decor brand:

             <h3>4. 'State of the Industry’ Surveys</h3>
             A survey that exists primarily for your market research can also be used as one of the best B2B lead magnets with an eye-catching CTA. Prospects provide their opinions on the topic related to your industry, and you can, in turn, collect data about their interests. 

             For example, imagine you’re planning to conduct a survey on ‘The state of SEO’ for a report that focuses on fresh industry trends. 
             
             You can encourage users to answer the survey questions and share their contact details in exchange for the whole industry report for free. Better yet, you can also offer the survey results as a data pack in exchange. 
             
             Make it clear that, in putting this report together, their opinions matter to you and other people in your niche. 
             
             Here’s how Angelfish Opinions does it:<br>

             <h3>5. Online Demos</h3>
             Live demos are useful if your product is relatively complicated, as there are always users who will skip over the “read the manual” step. After all, how often do you read the manual before you buy a product?

             Engaging your customers in a question-and-answer session can connect them ‘live’ with your customer care. Let them pick a preferable date and time, connect with them via any
              convenient messenger service of your choice, and voila – your prospect is willingly engaging with you.

         <div class="Global">
             <h3>6. Webinars and Podcasts</h3>
             Both webinars and podcasts offer new ways to engage with your audience and can be 
             extremely rewarding. 

Firstly, you can ask industry experts to take part in your webinar. 
The more interesting the topic and the more recognizable the expert,
 the more people are likely to be engaged.

Secondly, promote your company’s expert reputation. Provide customers with
 useful tips while showing them the benefits of your offer, and share your industry expertise with them.
You'll be building your brand image as someone who assists and grows specialists.<br>

         <div class="Global">
          <h3>7. Online Events</h3>
          You can go even further and organize online events, such as industry conferences and roundtable discussions. 

          Virtual events are similar to offline gatherings, but are not restricted to a single location. This is especially beneficial in these times when remote working and online meetings are becoming the norm. 
          
          Instead of granting open admission, ask people to leave their email addresses to register for an event. 
          
          As an example of this, we at SEMrush wanted marketing specialists to have the opportunity to learn from other professionals in the industry and exchange knowledge. 
          That’s why Global Marketing Day, a free 24-hour online marketing event, was established. <br>

      <div class="Global">
        <h3>8. Free Trials</h3>
        Free trials allow your product to sell itself, eliminating such obstacles as marketing, advertising and potentially pushy messaging. When your customers decide that they need your product after trying it for some time, then you’ve provided them with a great experience.

If your product is sophisticated, complicated, or simply needs time to illustrate its benefits,
 offer a free trial like Netflix does:  <br>
        
    </div>
    <div class="Global">
      <h3>9. Contests</h3>
      The opportunity to get a freebie with an email can be far more engaging than the standalone message itself. 

      Contests have the potential to go viral. Challenge your audience and get them feeling excited about your offer, 
      as in the following example of a consultation package giveaway from a marketing agency:
      To participate, the agency hooked users in by asking them to share how they wanted to activate their business and marketing goals for 2020. 
      This is a great way for them to engage more potential customers in their network.
